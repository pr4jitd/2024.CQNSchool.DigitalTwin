The course aims to provide training for quantum network simulation and modeling, emphasizing starting from first principles to model elementary quantum links for realistic deployed quantum networks. Essential topics in quantum information and quantum optics will also be surveyed. We will be using the QuREBB package for a part of the course, and using some bespoke code for the other part.


## Curriculum

1. Dirk Englund: Introduction to Quantum Network Simulations
2. Prajit Dhara: Midpoint Source Protocol Simulation
3. Hyeongrak "Chuck" Choi:  QuREBB: Quantum Remote Entanglement Building Block Simulations

## Running Notebooks
[![Pipenv](https://img.shields.io/badge/pipenv-locked-brightgreen)](https://pipenv.pypa.io/)

The virtual environment in this QuREBB repository is managed by [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).
To install pipenv you can use pip:

```bash
$ pip install pipenv --user
```

Using pipenv you then want to install all the dependencies of the repository by syncing with pipenv.
First navigate in the terminal to the QuREBB folder. Then run:

```bash
$ pipenv sync
```

Once you are synced you can go into a shell of this virtual enviroment (again while being in the QuREBB folder):

```bash
$ pipenv shell
```

The commands you now run are within this virtual enviroment, e.g.:

```bash
$ jupyter lab
```
To build documentation locally (you must have the jupyter-book package installed), please run (from the parent folder of your respository):

```bash
$ jupyter-book build 2024.CQNSchool.DigitalTwin/ 
```
