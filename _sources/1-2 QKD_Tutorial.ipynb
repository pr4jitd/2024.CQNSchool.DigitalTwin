Quantum Key Distribution is specifically useful for creating keys to be used in classical encryption schemes like this one.\n","\n","The basic idea is as follows:\n","First, you and the receiving party share a private one-time pad (in this case, \"KEY\" is in QKD is the \"one-time Pad\") that you and the receiving party each know. For secure communication, this one-time pad must be truly random to ensure no part of it can be guessed, and can only be used once, as multiple reuses mean there is a chance it could be reconstructed. In this exercise we ignore both of these security requirements just to show how it works.\n","\n","To transmit a secure message, you choose a plaintext message (in this case, \"Hey\") that you would like to transmit via a public (interceptable) channel. You then convert that message into a binary string to transmit using ASCII encoding standards. You can represent these classical bits \"0\" as a $|\\mathbf{0}\\rangle$ and a \"1\" as a $|\\mathbf{1}\\rangle$ state.\n","\n","Next, you apply the XOR operators $\\hat{O}_{\\mathrm{XOR}(0)}$ or $\\hat{O}_{\\mathrm{XOR}(1)}$ to the plaintext message, depending on the key value being \"0\" or \"1\" respectively. So for example if the first key bit is \"0\", and plaintext bit is \"0\" (as shown below) you apply $\\hat{O}_{\\mathrm{XOR}(0)} |\\mathbf{0}\\rangle = |\\mathbf{0}\\rangle$. If instead the plaintext bit is \"1\", then you apply $\\hat{O}_{\\mathrm{XOR}(0)} |\\mathbf{1}\\rangle = |\\mathbf{1}\\rangle$. If the key bit is \"1\", you apply operator $\\hat{O}_{\\mathrm{XOR}(1)}$, defined as $\\hat{O}_{\\mathrm{XOR}(1)} |\\mathbf{1}\\rangle = |\\mathbf{0}\\rangle$ and $\\hat{O}_{\\mathrm{XOR}(1)} |\\mathbf{0}\\rangle = |\\mathbf{1}\\rangle$.
