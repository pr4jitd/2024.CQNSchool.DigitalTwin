    "Welcome to the **QuREBB**! Here, we introduce a modular theoretical framework designed for the comprehensive understanding and comparison of various photon-mediated remote entanglement protocols (REPs). This notebook is based on the framework and results outlined in our tutorial paper [\"Tutorial: Remote entanglement protocols for stationary qubits with photonic interface\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19878v1). Structured into four distinct layers, this framework facilitates the assembly of modules by connecting one's output to another's input, elucidating the intricate mechanisms underpinning entanglement.\n",

    "The primary strength of our framework is its capability to delineate common features inherent to different remote entanglement protocols. Beyond this, it is designed with adaptability at its core, enabling users to modify modules with precision. This adaptability is crucial to compare a protocol across diverse quantum hardware setups or to test an array of protocols on a consistent hardware foundation. Such modularity and precision often remain elusive in dedicated entanglement simulations tailored for specific experimental setups. Dive deep into the intricacies of photon-mediated entanglement generation between qubit systems, and leverage the robust capabilities of our simulation suite."

    "## Photon-mediated Remote Entanglement Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "Photon-mediated remote entanglement protocols are essential in quantum networks, quantum computing, and quantum communication, with the synthesis of quantum mechanics and photonic technology. These protocols enable the generation of quantum entanglement between stationary qubits (often called \"quantum memory\") over long distances. At the core of these protocols is the utilization of photons as intermediaries, leveraging their inherent stabilities over optical fibers. This approach not only circumvents the limitations posed by the direct interaction of qubits but also harnesses the speed and coherence properties of photons, making long-range quantum communication feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of these protocols lies in their potential to create extensive quantum networks, similar to the internet, but operating on the principles of quantum mechanics. Such networks could revolutionize data security through quantum cryptography and enable distributed quantum computing, where computational tasks are shared across multiple quantum nodes. The development of photon-mediated remote entanglement protocols is thus a critical step towards realizing the full potential of quantum technologies. It merges the realms of quantum photonics, where light-matter interactions are manipulated at the quantum level, with quantum information science, offering innovative solutions to the challenges of scalability and robustness in quantum systems."

    "\n",
    "The advantage of this framework is that it gives insights into the common features of remote entanglement protocols. Moreover, it allows easy modification of the modules to compare a protocol with different types of quantum hardware or to rearrange the quantum hardware and test different protocols with the same hardware. Dedicated simulations of entanglement generation for a given experiment usually lack this flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 illustrates the framework. We start by explaining the high-level idea and how the first layer (logical building block and topology) can describe REPs in a generic manner. Next, we introduce the encoding and physical building block layers, which link the protocol to specific hardware. Finally, the quantum optical modeling layer provides a detailed, quantitative description of the physical building blocks. Our focus is on qubits realized with a single spin in atomic or solid-state systems, but the framework can incorporate other systems such as the spin wave in an atomic ensemble and optomechanical resonators, as well as superconducting qubits. These single entangled links between qubits could later be extended to multi-spin encoding for error correction for fault-tolerant quantum networks."

From left to right, we consider three main REP topologies: the detection-in-midpoint, sender-receiver, and source-in-midpoint topology.

(c) **Physical Building Blocks (PBB)** - The physical building blocks (PBBs) are the quantum channel describing the operations of the physical systems including imperfections. This layer shows the REP at the physical level. The first panel describes the construction of spin-photon gates with an overcoupled cavity QED system for state conditional amplitude reflection. The second panel shows the implementation of a measurement of the time-bin qubit in the X-basis, using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. (d) **Quantum optical modeling** - This layer models the hardware used in the PBB. In this example the relevant parameters for the PBBs (e.g. state-dependent reflection coefficient, $r_{\\ket{0}, \\ket{1}}$) can be calculated from physical variables (e.g. spin-cavity coupling rate, $g$), using a detailed quantum optical model.

    "We have released a software package titled QuREBB (Quantum Remote Entanglement Building Block simulations), available in an accompanying GitHub repository. This package offers a comparison of three exemplary entanglement protocols. For each protocol, we review every layer, from the idealized version to its practical implementation. As an example, we assume that the protocols are implemented with silicon-vacancy color centers in diamond nanophotonic cavities. This serves as a Tutorial on how to effectively employ our theoretical framework for the construction and quantitative analysis of the protocol's performance. The modular structure of our software implementation mirrors the framework, enabling the implementation of complex quantum systems from the physical to the network levels. Users can easily add new physical devices or logical units without interfering with existing functionality. Our ``named quantum object'' simplifies the tensor operations of different quantum subsystems by indexing them by names instead of numerical values."

In Fig. 2(b) we show how LBBs compare to elementary circuit diagrams, and in Fig. 2(c) how they can be used to construct different protocol topologies. The LBBs are not hardware-specific, as the practical details on what generates this operation and the dependence on physical parameters are described in the physical building block layer. "

    "### Topology of the protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "In the detection-in-midpoint topology, both endpoints generate spin-photon entanglement. The photons are then measured in the middle, in an entangled basis using a Bell state measurement. This projects the two spins in an entangled state. The detection-in-midpoint topology has an advantage in its simplicity. At its most basic, this topology requires only photon-emission from the spins, beamsplitter interference of the photons, and single-photon detections at the central station. Efficient spin-photon interfaces like optical cavities, while helpful, are not necessary to get high-fidelity entanglement. Furthermore, the time overhead for classical communication is reduced by half compared to the other topologies, since the endpoints communicate solely with the detection point, eliminating the need for direct communication between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sender-receiver topology, the first endpoint generates spin-photon entanglement, and the photon is then sent to the second endpoint, where it interacts with the spin, such that entanglement between the spins is achieved. This interaction can be a gate-like behavior (e.g. by using an optical cavity) after which the photon is measured. Alternatively, the photon can be absorbed by the spin-photon interface in which case this topology matches the workings of quantum state transfer [2, 3]. The sender-receiver topology does not necessitate an intermediary station for the spins to become entangled. However, the classical communication time for the heralding signal is twice as long compared to a detection-in-midpoint, as it needs to travel the full distance as opposed to half of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source-in-midpoint topology has an entangled photon source in the middle which sends these photons to the endpoints. The endpoints have an entangling interaction between the spin and the photon, after which the photons are measured and the spins will be projected into an entangled state. The source-in-midpoint topology is useful in satellite-assisted entanglement protocols. Ground-to-satellite channel (uplink) has a higher overall loss than the satellite-to-ground channel (downlink). Phenomenologically, this phenomenon is collectively referred to as the “shower curtain effect” of the atmosphere. In particular, the diffraction and deflection by air turbulence are more severe in the early stage of transmission than in the late stage on the dispersed beam. Moreover, practical factors such as limited onboard optics on the satellite result in a larger pointing error in the uplink than the downlink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote entanglement between two stationary qubits has been experimentally realized with sender-receiver topology using trapped atoms embedded in optical cavities, and with detection-in-midpoint using several platforms including NV centers in diamond, quantum dots, trapped ions, and neutral atoms."

    "### Spin-Photon Interface blocks \n",
    "The key logical building block of a REP is the spin-photon interface block since this is the interaction between the stationary and flying qubits. \n",
    "In this work, we focus on REPs that are heralded, using single-photon detection to screen out photon loss errors. Absorption-based spin-photon interfaces generally allow heralding only through additional energy levels in the stationary qubit. Thus, we give only a cursory treatment of absorption-based spin-photon interfaces. We identify four main categories of the spin-photon interface blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spin-Photon Emission** - A spin-photon emission block creates a photonic qubit entangled with the qubit state of the spin by emission through a higher level excited state. This is commonly achieved by the emission of a photon after spin-dependent excitation with a laser pulse. As an example, optical excitation of a spin in a superposition state will emit a photon depending on the spin state: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}_s+\\ket{1}_s) \\xrightarrow{\\text{laser}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}_s+\\ket{\\text{excited}}_s) \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0}_s\\ket{0}_p+\\ket{1}_s\\ket{1}_p)$, where the subscript $s$ ($p$) labels the state of the spin (photonic mode), and $\\ket{1}_s$ is the spin's bright state that is excited and emit a single photon. Alternatively, the system can be brought to an excited state where two different decay channels lead to two different spin states. The emitted photons can have for example a different polarization entangled with the spin state.  Various optically active quantum systems have realized spin-photon emission through spin-dependent optical excitation or decay to different spin states, including NV centers in bulk diamonds, neutral atoms, trapped ions, and quantum dots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spin-Photon Gate** - A spin-photon gate block is a conditional gate between the spin and a photon. Depending on the exact implementation, this will act as a controlled Z- or controlled X-rotation on the photonic qubit. Spin-photon gate blocks require a strong coupling of photons with the stationary qubit, and this is realized by confining the light with photonic cavities or waveguides. In some cases, the need for strong coupling can be relaxed at the expense of a non-deterministic but heralded gate operation. Examples of practical implementation of spin-photon gate LBB are trapped atoms in Fabry-Perot cavities, SiV centers in diamond photonic crystal cavities, and quantum dots in photonic crystal waveguides.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Spin-Photon Projector** -A spin-photon projector block selects only specific states from the input state. With the right input state and the right selection, this results in spin-photon entanglement. This method is sometimes referred to as \"carving\". An example is where the input state is in a superposition for both the photon and spin qubit (note that the $\\ket{0}_p$ is referring to the qubit state, not the vacuum state): $\\frac{1}{2}(\\ket{0}_s\\ket{0}_p+ \\ket{0}_s\\ket{1}_p+\\ket{1}_s\\ket{0}_p+ \\ket{1}_s\\ket{1}_p)$ and the spin-photon interface has a photonic loss that depends on both the spin and photon state. In this example, a spin-photon interface that has photon loss for the photon in the scenario's $\\ket{0}_s\\ket{1}_p $and $\\ket{1}_s\\ket{0}_p$ would create with 50\\% chance the state $\\frac{1}{2}(\\ket{0}_s\\ket{0}_p+ \\ket{1}_s\\ket{1}_p)$. So heralding no photon loss by photon detection ensures that only (an entangled) part of the incoming state is selected. This approach was used for entangling two neutral atoms in a cavity and with silicon-vacancy centers in diamond photonic crystal cavities for the demonstration of an asynchronous Bell state measurement between two photons. The downside is that it has intrinsic losses as it rejects part of the incoming state rather than performing a deterministic gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spin-Photon Absorption**\n",
    "The spin-photon absorption block transfers the photon state to the spin state. The block often implements a strong interaction using a cavity or spin ensemble. The absorption of a photon from lossy channels results in the vacuum field and does not herald the entanglement by photodetection resulting in low fidelities. Instead, spin-photon absorption can be useful if carefully used. For example, one can read the spin state after the absorption, effectively constructing a heralded protocol. Alternatively, one can make a high optical-depth spin ensemble absorb a single photon from a photon-pair source and use the other photon from the source. If the channel loss is negligible, the spin-photon absorption can directly implement quantum state transfer without classical communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "![QuREBBrepo](Images/QuREBB-2b1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 2(b)** displays the LBBs available to construct the REP. The circuit description outlines their idealized operations, which the user can match with the diagrams in Figure (a). For the spin-photon projector and the spin-photon absorption, an approximate gate diagram is given. This can be used to see how they can be used in the quantum circuits in (a). The exact gate description for these LBBs would be a projector operation and a SWAP gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Photon blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Photon source**\n",
    "Photon source blocks can be considered as the initialization of photonic qubits. High-rate entanglement generation with photon sources requires the deterministic generation of single photons with high-efficiency quantum emitters or photon-pair generation followed by the heralding. For high fidelities, single photons need to be indistinguishable, which is often challenging in a solid-state environment. The distinguishability problem is considered in the quantum optical modeling layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Photon pair sources**\n",
    "Photon pair sources provide entangled photon pairs, which can be used for REPs with source-in-midpoint topology. This can be understood as two photons initialized in an entangled state. Mid-point on-demand entangled photon pair sources have been proposed based on correlated photon decay from quantum emitters, mode-mixing of single photons or multiplexing spontaneous pair sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that at the LBB level, photon pair sources output perfect Bell states in the logical basis, $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$. The photonic basis of the states is determined in the photonic encoding layer, and imperfections, such as probabilistic photon pair generation, are detailed in the quantum optical modeling of physical building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Photon measurement**\n",
    "Generally in the REPs, the photon is still entangled with the spins before detection. For example in the sender-receiver topology (middle circuit Fig. 2(a)) the state before the measurement is \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\ket{0}_p(\\ket{00}_{AB}+\\ket{11}_{AB}) + \\ket{1}_p(\\ket{01}_{AB}+\\ket{10}_{AB})\\right),\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $A$ and $B$ refer to the two separate spins. This means that the photon needs to be measured on a basis that preserves entanglement between the spins, this is in the $Z$-basis for this situation. In this measurement of the photonic qubit, the outcome heralds a different entangled state on the spins, in this example measurement of $\\ket{0}$ for the photon heralds $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{00}+\\ket{11})$. One can choose to feedback on one of the spins to always generate the same entangled state or use the measurement outcome in post-processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bell State Measurement**\n",
    "Photonic Bell state measurement projects the state of two photons into one of four Bell states, $\\ket{\\Psi^\\pm} = \\ket{01}\\pm\\ket{10}, \\ket{\\Phi^\\pm} = \\ket{00}\\pm\\ket{11}$. When it is required to have a quantum operation between two photons, for example in the detection-in-midpoint topology, the Bell state measurement can be used. This is advantageous as in linear optics the photons do not interact. This can be achieved with a beamsplitter and photon measurement after the beamsplitter. The Bell state measurement projects two photons into an entangled state. It is usually used for entanglement swapping of two spin-photon-entangled pairs to yield entangled spins. Note that the Bell state measurement with linear optics is probabilistic with only 50\\% chance of succeeding. However, with auxiliary single photons, one can boost the success probability to 75\\%\n",

On top of these there are processes, which in an ideal scenario do not do anything to the photonic and spin qubits. Their implementation will, however, add noise, for example, a photonic loss in a fiber or quantum frequency conversion of the photons. These blocks do not change the logical states of qubits in the ideal situation, so they appear as identity operators in the circuit diagrams of the LBB layer and they can be modeled in detail as PBBs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a photonic loss block can be added, which takes care of the losses in the system, this does not change the ideal operation of the protocol but will impact the rate and fidelity in the simulations (which is implemented in the PBB). \n",

    "For a long-distance entanglement generation, it is advantageous to use photons in the telecom band to improve photon transmission using ultralow-loss fibers. As the physical platforms used for spin-photon interfaces have limited access to those wavelengths, quantum frequency conversion is often used to match the photon wavelength of the spin-photon interface with the desired communication band. In this case, one can model and add a frequency conversion block to protocols."

In this tutorial, we will use the term dual-rail exclusively as spatial modes encoding. Each of the encoding schemes has two states acting as the qubit basis.

Despite these complications, Fock-state encoding has a significant advantage in that Bell measurement is possible with the detection of a single photon, while the other encodings need the detection of two single photons. The success probability of a heralded protocol scales linearly with the probability of photon loss if only single-photon detection is needed, while it scales quadratically for two-photon detection (in all but Fock state encoding). In cases where photon losses are significant, due to long-distance transmission or devices with low efficiency, the linear scaling given by Fock-state encoding can provide a key advantage over other encodings."

    "**Time-bin encoding** - Time-bin encoding counteracts the drawbacks of Fock-state encoding at the expense of the requirement of two-photon detection for Bell measurement. Two time bins (early and late) are chosen to encode the photons. Photon loss can always be detected, in the ideal case of detectors with no dark counts, as this would result in no detection of photons. Therefore, the fidelity of protocols with time-bin encoding is not compromised, as long as dark counts are negligible with respect to the signal, but the rate decreases. Another advantage is relaxed phase stability: the optical phases should be stable on the time scale of the spacing of the time bins. However, arbitrary qubit operations are hard to implement, but the encoding is quite robust against noise sources such as dispersion or birefringence in the transmission medium. Therefore this encoding is mostly used in sending quantum information over long fibers and not in situations that require full control over the photonic qubit state."

Single-qubit gates are easily implemented, as all single-qubit rotations can be performed with waveplates. Moreover, polarization encoding requires phase stability between the two polarization bases. This stability can be readily attained in free space. In single-mode optical fibers the polarization is preserved but temperature and stress fluctuations in the fiber can rotate the polarization, stabilization and calibration is therefore required. Polarization maintaining (PM) fibers decouple the two different polarization bases by using orthogonal modes with different effective indices.

These PBBs are all controlled with a classical laser control pulse and the output is a single photon (or a weak coherent state depending on the exact implementation) entangled with the spin.  When the interaction between the light and the emitter is very strong, we can get a reflection of a single photon or weak coherent state where the amplitude or phase of the reflected light is controlled by the spin state.

For the time-bin encoding, we initialize the spin state in an equal superposition and apply the excitation twice with a $\\pi$-pulse of the spin in the middle. For the polarization of frequency encoding, both spin states need to have an optical transition with a different polarization or frequency. The entanglement can either be generated by initializing the spin in an equal superposition and exciting both transitions or by relying on an optical transition that has an equal chance of decaying to either state correlated with a different polarization or frequency. \n",

The driving field and the spontaneously emitted photons, which would act as noise sources, can be separated and filtered out from the scattered photons since they have different frequencies.

This is achieved with an overcoupled cavity where the back side of the cavity has a much higher reflectivity than the front such that the photon will not be transmitted.

When a non-perfectly cycling optical transition is present, which means that under continuous driving there is a (small) probability of spontaneously decaying to a different state than the ones involved in the transition, it is possible to use optical pumping. By laser excitation of the non-cycling transition, the system will eventually decay to the desired qubit state and remain there as this is not driven by the laser. In systems with a very good readout, it can be advantageous to read and generate the desired initialized state with a control pulse conditional on the readout result.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Readout** - The qubits we are considering have a good spin-photon interface, which allows for optical readout of the spin. The spin can read out by the detection of the state-dependent fluorescence. For high fidelity of this readout, high collection efficiency and good cyclicity of the optical transition are needed. A good cyclicity results in a transition that can be driven for a long time generating as many photons as possible before the qubit decays to an unwanted state, a high collection efficiency allows for measuring enough photons for a high-fidelity readout with a shorter driving time and lower probability of the qubit changing state. When a conditional phase reflection PBB (see next section) is used the spin state can be read out by phase readout.\n",

    "**Auxiliary qubits** - To go beyond a single entangled link it is essential to have auxiliary qubits for storage of quantum states in the system. This is for example required for entanglement distillation and entanglement swapping in repeater schemes. The available auxiliary qubits are highly dependent on the system and can go from nuclear spins in solid-state emitters to different species of atoms or ions in those systems. The most difficult requirement to fulfill for these qubits is often that they need to be resilient for entanglement attempts on the spin qubit, which typically involves a lot of initialization and control pulses. This can result in a competition between the coupling required for two-qubit gates and the isolation required for resilience during entanglement attempts."

    "The noises can be divided into spectral diffusion and dephasing by their time scales. Especially for solid-state emitters, the fluctuation of the local charge environment is often slower than the nanoseconds' lifetime of the transition. These charge fluctuations can change the spacing of the energy levels involved in the optical transition by Stark effect, causing the frequency to change. This effect is called spectral diffusion. Spectrally diffused transitions have fluctuating resonance frequency, shot-to-shot, that can be modeled with a Gaussian distribution of standard deviation $\\sigma_\\omega$. The fidelity of spectrally diffused spin-photon interfaces can be calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation, statistically averaging over the distribution function.\n",

The noise is modeled as random phase flips, or equivalently, pure-dephasing without longitudinal relaxation. For pure dephasing $\\gamma^*$, the transition is further broadened by $\\gamma^*$ from radiative broadening, and the lineshape is Lorentzian. If the fluctuation time scale of a noise is in an intermediate regime, the dynamics of the spin-photon interfaces and the resulting fidelity of entanglement requires a complete specification of the noise as a stochastic random process.\n",

Quantum optical modeling of a two-level system coupled to an optical cavity is a well-studied subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 6(b) shows relevant quantities of the emitter-cavity system. The dynamics of an emitter-cavity coupled system are governed by three parameters, $\\gamma$, $\\kappa$, and $g$. The emitter (cavity) transition linewidth $\\gamma$ ($\\kappa$) is the inverse time of emitter decay (cavity relaxation). Spontaneously emitted photons into free space, non-radiative decays, and decays into phonon sidebands fall outside the coherent cavity-emitter interactions and are considered as a relaxation channel of the system, incorporated in $\\gamma$. The dynamics of a cavity-emitter coupled system are governed by the coupling rate $g$. Physically, $g$ is the Rabi-frequency when the emitter is driven by a vacuum cavity electric field (zero-point electric field multiplied by the transition dipole moment).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The cooperativity of the system is defined as:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    C &= \\frac{4 g^2}{\\kappa \\gamma}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The cooperativity gauges the strength of coherent interaction relative to the dissipation, and higher cooperativity improves the efficiency of spin-photon interfaces. In REPs, this directly translates to the rate and the fidelities.\n",
    "\n",
    "While $\\kappa, g$, and $\\gamma$ are usually set parameters once the device is realized, the operation point of the cavity-emitter system can often be tuned. In the right side of Fig. 6(b) we indicate the energy relations that determine the operation point. The frequencies $\\omega_c, \\omega_a$, and $\\nu$ are related to the energies of the cavity mode, atomic transition, and external source (laser or single photon). The detuning between the cavity and emitter, $\\delta_{ac}$, determines how the emitter and cavity couple and what is the amplitude and phase response of the system. The external source frequency, which we define with respect to the cavity as $\\delta_{cl}$, can be optimized to obtain the desired phase or amplitude when interacting with the cavity.\n",
    "Realistically, there are often additional optical transitions that couple (or are close) to the cavity. Here, we depict a common level scheme for solid-state emitters, the Voigt configuration. When the energy difference between the target transition (here involving the bright state $\\ket{1}$) and other transitions is comparable to the cavity linewidth, emitter linewidth, or coupling rate, or the input light is not far-detuned, undesired interaction of the dark $\\ket{0}$ state can lead to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cavity loss channels, $\\kappa_{t, r, l}$, determine the cavity behavior. It is useful to relate the losses to the cavity input channel, which we take to be $\\kappa_r$, in this way, we can define the cavity output coupling as critically coupled ($\\kappa_l + \\kappa_t = \\kappa_r$), undercoupled ($\\kappa_l+\\kappa_t > \\kappa_r$) or overcoupled ($\\kappa_l + \\kappa_t < \\kappa_r$). The first and latter regimes are particularly interesting for a cavity-based spin-photon interface: an over-coupled cavity is sometimes called a single-sided cavity as the preferential output channel is the one used for probing the cavity; therefore emitted photons will be funneled in the collected optical mode, while incident photon will almost always be reflected back to the same port; this cavity is used in the conditional phase reflection PBB. A critically-coupled cavity allows both transmission and reflection to potentially be used as output channels, this is the cavity used for a conditional amplitude reflection PBB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emission-based spin-photon interfaces can be realized using a bare emitter, though this can pose a severe limitation to the entanglement generation rate when quantum efficiencies and/or Debye-Waller factors are low. In addition, especially for the spontaneous emission, spectral diffusion and dephasing directly affect the photon indistinguishability and thus the entanglement fidelity. The efficiency and the fidelity of a spin-photon interface can be improved with a cavity: the Purcell effect enhances the emission of the optical transition by decreasing the lifetime and increasing the fraction of photons emitted by the target transition (e.g. zero-phonon line for solid-state spins). At the same time, the optical linewidth broadening coming from the lifetime reduction decreases the relative effect of incoherent broadening mechanisms. The Purcell factor is defined as;\n",

    "for the emitter located at $\\vec{r}_e$, and $\\epsilon(\\vec{r})$ is the permittivity as a function of coordinates. If the cavity has sufficiently high quality factor and small mode volume, resulting in $g>\\kappa, \\gamma$, the system enters the strong coupling regime, and the overall outcoupling efficiency of the emitted photons can become inefficient. This is because the cavity photon can be reabsorbed into the emitter before escaping the cavity. In the strong coupling regime, the outcoupling efficiency is,\n",

    "assuming $\\kappa_t = 0$ and $\\kappa_r$ is the output port of the emitted photons. Equation above separates the contribution of cavity outcoupling and the fractional photon decay through the cavity. Thus, for example, reducing $\\kappa_r$ does not help the efficiency as it decreases both factors. Furthermore, in the strong coupling regime, the wavepacket of photons oscillates with a coupling rate $g$, which makes the indistinguishability significantly susceptible to both $g$ and $\\kappa+\\gamma$. When designing a cavity for entanglement, optimal parameters should be chosen within the trade-off space, rather than just strengthening the interaction, which often places the system in weak coupling or bad-cavity regimes ($\\kappa >> g >> \\gamma$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Spin-photon gate and spin-photon projector LBBs, by contrast, are based on the efficient coherent scattering of a single photon or weak coherent state by the emitter, which in turn requires strong interaction between the emitter's dipole and a photonic mode. \n",
    "Spatial confinement of an optical mode by means of optical cavities or light-guiding structures (i.e. waveguides or optical fibers) enables this strong interaction. Here we will focus on the use of cavities, as the scattering and emission of an emitter are similar except for the numerical calculation of the coupling. In the strong coupling regime, the response of the cavity to incoming photons with the cavity system is modulated in amplitude and phase by the state of the emitter. The cavity-emitter parameters and chosen operation points (in terms of cavity-emitter detuning and photon frequency) can be used together with the system input-output formalism relations to determine the response of the system, in terms of reflection and transmission coefficients and loss. The spin-dependent reflection and transmission coefficients are complex-valued and describe the amplitude and phase of the photon after the interaction. They are used to realize spin-photon gates and spin-photon projectors. In practice, this can be either changing the amplitude or the phase of the photonic state, conditioned on the spin being in the bright state. When modulating phase, it is convenient to use a single-sided cavity as almost all photons will be reflected optimizing the efficiency, while amplitude modulation benefits from a critically coupled cavity maximizing the contrast of the field amplitudes. As anticipated, it is possible that the unwanted transition is close in frequency that it also couples to the cavity. In such cases, the relative phase or amplitude contrast between the system response has to be optimized for high fidelity of the spin-photon emission. This can be done by changing the operation point, i.e. the emitter-cavity detuning and the input photon frequency.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we introduced a modular framework to describe photon-mediated remote entanglement protocols. Our framework divides the remote entanglement protocols into four different layers, allowing a perspective of the entanglement protocol from an abstract and hardware-agnostic overview to a detailed description of each component and physical implementation. We describe the function of the different layers and provide examples of their realization, including detailed modeling of cavity-based spin-photon interfaces. Finally, using a software implementation that directly reflects the modular approach of the framework, we simulated different remote entanglement protocol topologies based on a realistic experimental platform and investigated how they perform under different parameter regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future work, our framework can expand into both higher-level uses and lower-level descriptions. At the higher level, leveraging the logical operations of the LBB layer can construct error-corrected encoded quantum networks. Incorporating error correction schemes into our framework would enable the simulation of fault-tolerant quantum applications. On the other hand, the integration of material-level details of physics, for example, for the case of color centers, into our quantum optical modeling can help the choice of quantum systems to optimally configure the network. This inclusion of finer-grained aspects will enhance the accuracy of our simulations as well. In addition, we believe our framework can be extended to apply to continuous variable entanglement distribution and qudit entanglement distribution.\n"
